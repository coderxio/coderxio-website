Health Tech	Drug information	FDA	FDALabel	https://www.fda.gov/science-research/bioinformatics-tools/fdalabel-full-text-search-drug-labeling	Web-based application to search labeling documents of FDA-approved drug products	"The FDALabel Database is a web-based application used to perform customizable searches of over 130,000 human prescription, biological, over-the-counter (OTC), and animal drug labeling documents. The source of FDALabel's data is the FDA's Structured Product Labeling (SPL) archive, which stores labeling documents submitted by manufacturers. FDALabel is implemented as a secure three-tier application with an Oracle database."		
Health Tech	Drug information	FDA	openFDA	https://open.fda.gov/	"openFDA provides APIs and raw download access to a number of high-value, high priority and scalable structured datasets, including adverse events, drug product labeling, and recall enforcement reports."	"openFDA is the first innovation created by Taha Kass-Hout, MD, MS, upon joining FDA as the first Chief Health Information Officer in March 2013. The goal of the project is to create easy access to public data, to create a new level of openness and accountability, to ensure the privacy and security of public FDA data, and ultimately to educate the public and save lives. The concept was to index high-value, high priority and scalable public-access data, format and document that data in developer and consumer-friendly standards, and make that data available via a public-access portal that enables developers to quickly and easily use it in applications. Dr. Kass-Hout launched the project by obtaining a Presidential Innovation Fellow to focus on policy and programmatic issues in July 2013. The public cloud environment was determined in September 2013, and Dr. Kass-Hout's team solicited agency and user input into policies, first priority datasets, and desirable technical characteristics of openFDA. All the project milestones were met despite the government shutdown."		1

Data	Data sources	CMS	CMS 2008-2010 Data Entrepreneurs Synthetic Public Use File (DE-SynPUF)	https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Downloadable-Public-Use-Files/SynPUFs/DE_Syn_PUF	The DE-SynPUF was created with the goal of providing a realistic set of claims data in the public domain while providing the very highest degree of protection to the Medicare beneficiaries protected health information. 	"The DE-SynPUF was created with the goal of providing a realistic set of claims data in the public domain while providing the very highest degree of protection to the Medicare beneficiaries protected health information. The purposes of the DE-SynPUF are to: allow data entrepreneurs to develop and create software and applications that may eventually be applied to actual CMS claims data; train researchers on the use and complexity of conducting analyses with CMS claims data prior to initiating the process to obtain access to actual CMS data; and, support safe data mining innovations that may reveal unanticipated knowledge gains while preserving beneficiary privacy. The files have been designed so that programs and procedures created on the DE-SynPUF will function on CMS Limited Data Sets. The data structure of the Medicare DE-SynPUF is very similar to the CMS Limited Data Sets, but with a smaller number of variables. The DE-SynPUF also provides a robust set of metadata on the CMS claims data that have not been previously available in the public domain. Although the DE-SynPUF has very limited inferential research value to draw conclusions about Medicare beneficiaries due to the synthetic processes used to create the file, the Medicare DE-SynPUF does increase access to a realistic Medicare claims data file in a timely and less expensive manner to spur the innovation necessary to achieve the goals of better care for beneficiaries and improve the health of the population. The DE-SynPUF contains five types of data Beneficiary Summary, Inpatient Claims, Outpatient Claims, Carrier Claims, and Prescription Drug Events."
