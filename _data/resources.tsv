Health Tech	Drug information	FDA	FDALabel	https://www.fda.gov/science-research/bioinformatics-tools/fdalabel-full-text-search-drug-labeling	Web-based application to search labeling documents of FDA-approved drug products	"The FDALabel Database is a web-based application used to perform customizable searches of over 130,000 human prescription, biological, over-the-counter (OTC), and animal drug labeling documents.

Health Tech	Drug information	FDA	openFDA	https://open.fda.gov/	"openFDA provides APIs and raw download access to a number of high-value, high priority and scalable structured datasets, including adverse events, drug product labeling, and recall enforcement reports."	"openFDA is the first innovation created by Taha Kass-Hout, MD, MS, upon joining FDA as the first Chief Health Information Officer in March 2013. The goal of the project is to create easy access to public data, to create a new level of openness and accountability, to ensure the privacy and security of public FDA data, and ultimately to educate the public and save lives. The concept was to index high-value, high priority and scalable public-access data, format and document that data in developer and consumer-friendly standards, and make that data available via a public-access portal that enables developers to quickly and easily use it in applications. Dr. Kass-Hout launched the project by obtaining a Presidential Innovation Fellow to focus on policy and programmatic issues in July 2013. The public cloud environment was determined in September 2013, and Dr. Kass-Hout's team solicited agency and user input into policies, first priority datasets, and desirable technical characteristics of openFDA. All the project milestones were met despite the government shutdown."		1

Data	Data sources	CMS	CMS 2008-2010 Data Entrepreneurs Synthetic Public Use File (DE-SynPUF)	https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Downloadable-Public-Use-Files/SynPUFs/DE_Syn_PUF	The DE-SynPUF was created with the goal of providing a realistic set of claims data in the public domain while providing the very highest degree of protection to the Medicare beneficiaries protected health information. 	"The DE-SynPUF was created with the goal of providing a realistic set of claims data in the public domain while providing the very highest degree of protection to the Medicare beneficiaries protected health information. The purposes of the DE-SynPUF are to: allow data entrepreneurs to develop and create software and applications that may eventually be applied to actual CMS claims data; train researchers on the use and complexity of conducting analyses with CMS claims data prior to initiating the process to obtain access to actual CMS data; and, support safe data mining innovations that may reveal unanticipated knowledge gains while preserving beneficiary privacy. The files have been designed so that programs and procedures created on the DE-SynPUF will function on CMS Limited Data Sets. The data structure of the Medicare DE-SynPUF is very similar to the CMS Limited Data Sets, but with a smaller number of variables. The DE-SynPUF also provides a robust set of metadata on the CMS claims data that have not been previously available in the public domain. Although the DE-SynPUF has very limited inferential research value to draw conclusions about Medicare beneficiaries due to the synthetic processes used to create the file, the Medicare DE-SynPUF does increase access to a realistic Medicare claims data file in a timely and less expensive manner to spur the innovation necessary to achieve the goals of better care for beneficiaries and improve the health of the population. The DE-SynPUF contains five types of data Beneficiary Summary, Inpatient Claims, Outpatient Claims, Carrier Claims, and Prescription Drug Events."

"In the digital age, humans cannot physically read and digest every bit of information relevant to a given decision. In addition, almost every company has valuable data that is not being used - more often than not, documents are living in repositories with no line of sight. As a result, companies life science companies are making important and costly decisions with incomplete information. We aim to take companies like yours from a document-driven environment into a data-driven one.  We are reimagining how clinical trials are researched and planned by removing the barriers between data and end-users. We do this by mining massive amounts of trial-related documents from both customers and the public domain— so you don’t have to. Those data then become the foundation for machine learning insights and recommendations.Our goal is to get treatments to patients, faster."

"PBM developed the legacy software system/database making it available for operations and research to organize, track and analyze VA prescription data. The legacy database consisted of Fileman menu reports rolled up monthly from each VA facility for all outpatient dispensations, inpatient intravenous (IV) and unit dose (UD) orders. Each report was rolled up at the end of the month, drug data were standardized and aggregated into the PBM Rx Database. Upon development and release of the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW), PBM initiated use of CDW Outpatient Rx data as the foundation of the PBM Outpatient Rx Database and conducts extraction, tracking, loading and quality assurance efforts on a weekly basis to maintain the PBM Outpatient Rx data. (The data fields/views in CDW used are readily available in the CDW metadata and on CDW’s SharePoint.) Inpatient IV and UD data are still obtained using the legacy system. These three prescription-level extracts are available and may be used by researchers: The outpatient Prescription Extract, (OPRx), IV Extract (IVRx) and Unit Dose Extract (UDRx). The three Extracts are often referred to collectively as the PBM Rx Database. They contain extensive detail on the medications prescribed and characteristics of the prescriptions including:"	Requires IRB approval.

EHRN reports are reviewed internally and externally prior to publication. To expedite information sharing, they are published without traditional peer review. It’s important that good data be available sooner, rather than perfect data be available too late—especially in times of public health crisis. 
EHRN is where you’ll find our reports. We invite others to contribute as well, from health systems and higher learning institutions to government agencies. Our goal is for EHRN to light the way for fast, collaborative research."

"The app was designed to accomplish >90% of tasks in <20s of time, assuming the user is using keyboard navigation. This productivity savings combined with built-in error checking can result in up to $15-20k in annual cost savings in a high-volume addictions/psychiatry specialized pharmacy. This small app also unlocks novel workflows that help pharmacies cover edge cases (e.g. temp log forms for when patients come into the pharmacy while their medication is out for witnessed delivery). Finally, the forms look so good & organized, that a good impression is left on patients and doctors. Stole some patients from competing pharmacies this way."
